      <p>I wanna take the time to thank you.</p>
      <p>
        I never thought I'd be here when I started learning JS a year ago. A
        good deal of my tech knowledge comes from being involved in this project
        (and nearly all of my experience).{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        You've allowed me to discover my love of unit testing, typescript, and
        backend. I cannot wait to continue this journey.
