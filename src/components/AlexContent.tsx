        I never thought I'd be here when I started learning JS a year ago. A
        good deal of my tech knowledge comes from being involved in this project
        (and nearly all of my experience).

        There's so many small details and huge concepts that I understand
        because of you. You've allowed me to discover my love of typescript,
        unit testing, and backend. <br /> ðŸ§¬ &nbsp; &nbsp; ðŸ§ª &nbsp; &nbsp; ðŸ”™

        I can't thank you enough for always supporting me through the ups and
        downs. I can't &ndash; and don't want to &ndash; imagine where I'd be if
        I hadn't fought through the imposter syndrome and said yes to this
        opportunity. I can't wait to continue this journey.
